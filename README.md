# GravityTutorial

I have been trying to learn Android Development and started with Android Studio so after
a few tutorials I decided to work up one of my own projects.  This is based on an HTML5
JavaScript code i had created to simulate gravity with particles in a vacum.  Quite simple
but seemed a good starting place because I understood the code base being converted.

The initial commit is missing a lot and was more of a "Proof Of Concept" then any actual
working application but it does demonstrate some fundamentals of the tools.
